# odin-recipes

From this odin project I have learn the basic parts of HTML.

I have learned the boilerplate for single pages, such as DOCTYPE, HTML, meta, head, body.

I learned some techniques of text manipulation such as strong(bold), em(italics), and headers(h1,h2,...).

I also learned the other components such as img, a(anchor), ul(unorderlist),ol(orderedlist), li(list element).
