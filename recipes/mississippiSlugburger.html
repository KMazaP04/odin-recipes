    <p>
      WARNING: I do not include whole list of ingredients and steps. This burger
      looks kind of gross but had an interesting name which is why I decided to
      use it for this practice project.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will continue this project simply to get practice with git and vscode
      editor. The food I have presented here is simply just for show and I have
      no intention on creating this dish.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <l1>7 slices potato bread</l1>
      <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1 Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). Line a baking
        sheet with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2 Cut the crusts off the bread slices. Place slices on the prepared
        baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3 Bake in the center of the preheated oven until dry and toasted,
        about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4 Transfer toasted bread to the bowl of a food processor and pulse
        until you reach coarse crumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 5 Place ground chuck, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder
        into a bowl. Add bread crumbs. Combine with your fingers, breaking apart
        the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 6 Dampen your fingers with water and form mixture into hamburger
        patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 7 Heat ¼ to ½ inch vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high
        heat. Place a patty into the pan and turn heat down to medium. Cook
        until well browned and crusty, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with
        remaining patties, adding more oil if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 8 Remove from the pan and serve on hamburger buns with mustard and
        pickles; sprinkle tops of patties with chili powder and/or cayenne if
        you like prior to serving.
      </li>
